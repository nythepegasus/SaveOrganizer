# SaveOrganizer
Have you ever wanted to keep your save files in a central directory structure that made sense at first glance? Me too.

Currently this tool doesn't do a lot and is highly experimental, but it has high aspirations.

### Examples (Super Basic for right now)
```sh
mkdir Ruby # Example of a game save backup directory
save-organizer Ruby
# Created new profile 5A39E60A-F716-4BF0-AE38-E9100C12CF1C
save-organizer Ruby/5A39E60A-F716-4BF0-AE38-E9100C12CF1C
# Ruby/5A39E60A-F716-4BF0-AE38-E9100C12CF1C/24-11-30/03-09-50
```
